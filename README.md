# Individualized_Cooling_Data_Analysis
Matlab code to analyze blanketrol (water-cooling blanket temperatures), thermoesthesia (perception of cooling feedback), and skin temperature (LabChart temperature sensors (v0.#.#) or iButton temperature sensors (v1.#.#)) data collected during a perception-based, individualized cooling protocol used to activate and study brown adipose tissue in human subjects. 

## Resources
- [Release Notes](https://github.com/ccoolbaugh/Individualized_Cooling_Data_Analysis/releases "Release Notes")  
  - **Initial Release (Version 0.0.0)** analyzes skin temperature data acquired with [ADInstrument's skin temperature probes](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/skin-temperature-probes) and post-processed with [LabChart software](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart).  
  - **iButton Release (Version 1.0.0)** analyzes skin temperature data acquired with [iButton temperature sensors](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/pl_list.cfm/filter/22).  
  - To test the source code, we recommend analyzing the example data associated with S000 for V0.0.0 or S001 for V1.0.0 in the [Example-Data folder](https://github.com/ccoolbaugh/Individualized_Cooling_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Example-Data). Please refer to the [data dictionary](https://github.com/ccoolbaugh/Individualized_Cooling_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Example-Data/README.md) for more information about the contents of the example data.
